# Grocery-Store-Inventory-System
Programming Principles - Assignment 1 (Sem 2)
I am going to make a grocery store inventory system for local grocery store owners and small businesses. The program will be made using PyCharm coding language. The program would have an easy inetface and tools like time and date built in. The program would enable the employees and managers to add and delete items from the inventory easily and effieciently. 
The program would have a counter that will keep a record of all the products/goods available at any given time and also keep a record as to when was a specific product was added or deleted and by whom. It will show detailed description of all the items that are available. Managers should be able to see the total value of the products in stock and separtely as required. 
The program is going to have a simple interface so its easy to learn for the new employees. The program should be able to calculate the total value of revenue going in and out. It also would provide a report concisting of the products and the total value of purchases and revenue generated.
